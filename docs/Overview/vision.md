### A multi-chain automated protocol with expandable consensus mechanics for the new age of creator-centric economies.

Bitcoin is a single-purpose blockchain: it was created as a way for people to send and receive bitcoin cryptocurrency over the internet. While BTC is a great store of value, it is limited as it cannot be used to interact with applications built on blockchain technology.

Ethereum is the first multi-purpose blockchain: it was built as a platform that could facilitate programmatic “smart contracts”: which allow the automatic execution of agreements without the intervention of intermediaries like banks for financial transactions or lawful entities for legal arrangements. This invention, therefore, allowed many real-world applications to emerge (like DeFi), without any central entity behind them. But all financial services are dependent on available funds, and decentralized finance is no different. DeFi services rely on “liquidity pools”: smart contracts containing locked crypto tokens that have been supplied by the platform's users. This means that while ETH is allowed for very fast innovation in the DeFi space, all DeFi services have to compete with each other for who gets the most liquidity.

Newcoin is the first cooperative multi-purpose blockchain: it provides smart contracts to its users and because everyone shares the same infrastructure
