## Name extensions
In order to be easily memorable, each public key on the Newcoin blockchain will have a username under an extension.  
The default extension is ".io"

Extensions will be available according to an NFT auction system, where the owner of a specific extension (or account issuer) will be able to commercialise usernames under such extensions.
