## Why does Newcoin needs CPU, RAM and Network?
All Blockchains are based on shared resouces. And these need to be paid for.  
On Newcoin there are 3 different ones, that can very easily be explained like your phone.

The same, as on your phone, Newcoin has 3 resources limiting its possibility.  
First, the CPU, that is like the processor of your phone. It is used to execute transactions.
Then RAM, that basically is your permanent storage. If you want to safe a lot, you will need quite some storage.  
Last the Network. That is like your internet speed. The amount of Data that can be sent around in a specific time.  

## Infrastructure Fees

### Transaction fees
Each account will receive a quote of 8 free transaction per day which means absolutely no "gas fees" for transactions. Beyond that free, per account, quota, packages will be provided upon staking.


### Minting Assets

The minting of NFTs will depend on the amount of RAM required based on the amount of metadata stored on-chain for each NFT and will range between $0.01 and up to $5 for the RAM intensive assets.

Newcoin is not desiged for storing big files directly on the network. Even as this is possible, we would recommend to use an IPFS storage like [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/)

### Creating Accounts

In order to create an account, the account issuer will have to pay in $NCO for the RAM that will be made available to store the data related to the account. The amount will depend on the supply and demand for RAM and calculated via the Bancor algorithm. The price per account created should average around 5$ and the cost can be supported by the App developer, the account issuer or the account holder.  
Newmoon and Newstack can provide you with a set of free accounts.
